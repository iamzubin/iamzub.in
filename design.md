# Design Philosophy
The **Terminal CLI** aesthetic pays homage to the raw power of the command line. It strips away the "user interface" layers to reveal the "system" underneath. It is **brutally functional, high-contrast, and authentically retro**. It feels like hacking into a mainframe or configuring a server.

The vibe is **Cyber-Industrial, Hacker, and System-Level**. It is not "Matrix" rain (too cliché); it is a clean, usable ZSH/BASH shell environment.

**Key visual signatures:**
*   **Monospace Supremacy**: Every single character, from the largest headline to the smallest footer link, is monospaced.
*   **The Cursor**: The blinking block or underscore cursor `_` is the heartbeat of the interface.
*   **Shell Metaphors**: Use prompt characters (`>`, `$`, `~`), command flags (`--help`), and status codes (`[OK]`, `[ERR]`).
*   **Scanlines (Subtle)**: A very faint CRT scanline effect to give it depth without ruining readability.

# Design Token System

## Colors (Dark Mode Only)
The palette mimics a phosphor monitor. High contrast is non-negotiable.

*   **Background**: `#0a0a0a` (Deep black, but not pure OLED black to allow for scanlines)
*   **Foreground**: `#33ff00` (Classic Terminal Green) or `#ffb000` (Amber) - *Let's go with Green for this implementation as the primary, with Amber as secondary.*
    *   `primary`: `#33ff00` (Bright Neon Green)
    *   `secondary`: `#ffb000` (Amber/Orange for warnings or accents)
    *   `muted`: `#1f521f` (Dimmed green for borders/inactive text)
    *   `accent`: `#33ff00` (Same as primary, used for cursors/active states)
    *   `error`: `#ff3333` (Bright Red)
    *   `border`: `#1f521f` (Dimmed green)

## Typography
*   **Font**: `JetBrains Mono`, `Fira Code`, or `VT323`.
*   **Style**: **ALL CAPS** for headers. Lowercase for "code" or body text is acceptable, but consistency is key.
*   **Scale**: Strict modular scale. Headers shouldn't be "smooth"; they should snap to grid sizes.

## Radius & Borders
*   **Radius**: `0px`. Absolutely no rounded corners.
*   **Borders**: `1px` solid or dashed. Borders are crucial for defining "windows" or "panes".

## Shadows & Effects
*   **Shadows**: No drop shadows.
*   **Text Shadow**: A subtle "glow" for the primary text to mimic phosphor persistence.
    *   `text-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(51, 255, 0, 0.5)`
*   **CRT Overlay**: A pointer-events-none overlay with scanlines.

# Component Stylings

## Buttons
*   **Structure**: Text enclosed in brackets `[ INITIATE ]` or a solid block of color with inverted text.
*   **Hover**: The background fills with the primary color, text becomes black (inverted video).
*   **Active**: A "pressed" state might shift the text 1px down or blink rapidly.

## Cards (Windows/Panes)
*   **Structure**: A black box with a 1px green border.
*   **Header**: A "title bar" at the top: `+--- SYSTEM STATUS ---+` or a solid inverted bar.
*   **Content**: Padded monospaced text inside.

## Inputs
*   **Style**: No box. Just a prompt `user@acme:~$` followed by the input field.
*   **Cursor**: A blinking block `█` at the caret position.
*   **Focus**: No ring, just the blinking cursor.

# Layout Strategy
The layout should feel like a grid of terminal windows (`tmux` or `vim` splits).
*   **Strict Grid**: Content is aligned to a rigid character grid.
*   **Separators**: Use ASCII characters for dividers: `----------------` or `================` or `//`.

# Non-Genericness (The Bold Factor)
*   **ASCII Art**: Use ASCII art for the logo or key graphic elements.
*   **Typewriter Effect**: Headlines should appear character-by-character.
*   **Raw Data Visualization**: Stats shouldn't be pie charts; they should be progress bars `[||||||||||.....]`.

# Effects & Animation
*   **Blink**: Utilities for `animate-blink` (standard cursor blinking).
*   **Glitch**: Occasional subtle text offsets on hover.
*   **Typing**: `typing-demo` animation for the hero text.

# Iconography
*   **Lucide Icons**: Use them, but style them to look pixelated or low-fi if possible, or strict `stroke-width-2`.
*   **Color**: Icons are always the primary terminal color.

# Responsive Strategy
*   **Mobile**: The "windows" stack vertically. The text size remains legible (monospaced fonts can be wide, so watch for overflow). Wrap long lines with a `\` indicator.

# Accessibility
*   **Contrast**: The bright green on black exceeds AA requirements.
*   **Focus**: High visibility is inherent to this style (inverted colors).
