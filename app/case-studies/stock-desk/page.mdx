# 🧾 Case Study: Internal Stock Lookup and Booking System for Furniture Chain

## 🛠 Problem
A growing furniture brand with multiple retail stores was struggling with chaotic stock coordination.
Sales reps were:

- Constantly calling each other or factory staff to check item availability
- Managing a shared Google Sheet linked to an ERP system — which was slow, error-prone, and often outdated
- Avoiding the ERP entirely because it was too complex for most frontline staff

This led to booking delays, double-sales, and frustrated customers.

---

## 💡 Solution
I built a lightweight web-based internal tool tailored to their actual workflow. Store managers and reps could:

- 🔍 Search stock in real-time by model, size, color, etc.
- ✅ Instantly mark items as "sold" to block them from other stores
- 📦 Book orders with customer details & auto-generate a backend log

Only one backend staff member now needed to maintain the ERP — the rest just used the web UI, which synced with ERP in the background.

The system included login-based access and simple role separation between sales and factory dispatch.

## ⚙️ Stack
- React + Tailwind (frontend)
- Node.js + Express (backend)
- MongoDB for fast querying
- Hosted on Render for instant deployments

---

## 📈 Outcome
- 🔻 Reduced booking errors by 90%
- ⚡ Sales reps closed in-store sales faster with accurate stock visibility
- 🧾 Factory team had an organized booking log without chasing updates

## 🔍 Why It Worked
This wasn’t just about tech — it was about adapting to how Indian retail teams actually work. By building a simple interface over a complex ERP, we made the system usable for non-technical staff and let the business scale without adding operational chaos.
